        p1: "Dwyan Anthony Alford was born at 10:03am under the vibrant city lights of Brooklyn, New York, USA at the Maimonides Medical Center on November 23, 1972 to a Jamaican father and Trinidadian mother. Yet, the sprawling urban setting was but a mere prologue to his journey. A year later, his mother's homeland, Trinidad, called to him. The pulsating rhythms of soca and calypso were his lullabies. Trinidad, a cultural melting pot, was the backdrop to his earliest memories. In 1975 he returned to the United States attending the 'School of the Blessed Sacrament' on West 52nd Street.",
        p2: "Dwyan's journey was largely guided by his mother's role at the United Nations, which took them to Liberia in 1978. Liberia, being the first African republic, was on the brink of a tumultuous coup d'Ã©tat. As time passed, the next chapter opened in Kenya's Kenton College in 1980. From there, the journey veered westward to Ghana, the first country in Africa to gain independence from colonial rule, but amidst another military coup led by future President Jerry Rawlings. It was in Accra, the capital city, that Dwyan attended the Ghana International School.",
        p3: "In 1984, Dwyan journeyed to England to attend Queen's College. Amidst the English tea culture, punk rock, football fever, 'Ghostbusters' craze, Wimbledon Tennis and the iconic BBC series 'Eastenders', he immersed himself in the nation's long history, offering new perspectives and broadening his world view.",

        p1: "At the age of 18, having completed his A levels at Queen's College in Somerset, England, Dwyan returned to where it all began - New York. He attended New York University's Stern School of Business earning a double degree in Accounting and Marketing in 1996. The city, basking in the era of 'Seinfeld', 'The Cosby Show', hip hop evolution, the digitial revolution and baggy fashion trends, offered a familiar yet transformed landscape.",
        p2: "After graduation, Dwyan initially pursued a career in the accounting field. He soon realized that it wasn't for him. His creativity sought a different outlet, leading him to join 'Imagedog Videographics', where he trained to become a Graphic Designer. Here, Dwyan found a significant source of satisfaction, developing his graphic design skills developing Powerpoint slides for the company's main client, Pfizer.",
        p3: "His stint at 'Imagedog Videographics' ignited a spark in Dwyan when he discovered the world of video production and editing, taking him back to NYU for a certification in digital video production. He explored this new path producing and editing his first music video '41 Shots' honoring the life of Amadou Diallo in 2000, and then writing, producing, and starring in a short film titled 'The Day,' which was showcased later in New York City in 2002.",

        p1: "Just as the Covid-19 pandemic has redefined our lives recently, 9/11 was a day that reshaped the world, leaving an indelible mark on our collective memory. This overwhelming sense of uncertainty and the seismic shift in global perceptions stirred a profound change in Dwyan. It led him to leave the familiarity of the U.S. behind and embark on a new chapter abroad in Botswana, Africa where his mother retired several years earlier.",
        p2: 'By 2003, Dwyan found himself in Gaborone, Botswana, where he owned a digital video production company. Here, he crafted stories through his lens. As a business owner Dwyan worked with notable clients including De Beers, Coca Cola, The Bill and Melina Gates Foundation, Orange and many others, expanding his global experiences, wearing a number of hats at various times as Producer, Director, Editor and/or Camera Operator.',
        p3: "As the new decade came into focus, it became clear to Dwyan that the Internet was the future. He started to learn software development initially through using Content Management Systems (SMS) such as Wordpress and Joomla. This began his new found passion for coding and building applications from the ground up. He made arrangements to leave his career in video/film production and go fully into learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to build websites.",

        p2: "At Revature, Dwyan honed his proficiency in Test-Driven and Behavior-Driven Development, working with Java, Selenium, SQL, and Cucumber technologies. He developed and maintained high-quality, reliable software code, a clear extension of his creative abilities.",
